# RetroClips

A site that pairs a ~10 second clip from a famous *older* film with
~20 seconds of commentary underneath, plus a small illustrated
"reaction cam" watching along in the corner.

**Live:** https://retroclips.vercel.app/ (temporary Vercel-assigned
URL until a custom domain is connected — see "Not done yet" below).
Previously prototyped at
https://dietersilva.github.io/generative-ai-for-beginners/retroclips/
as a subdirectory of an unrelated curriculum repo; this repo is the
real home going forward.

## Why public domain, not fair use

The original pitch was "scrape clips from famous movies." Ten-second
clips paired with commentary is roughly what a lot of YouTube reaction
channels do, but that's not evidence the practice is legally safe to
build a site on: there's no bright-line duration that makes a clip
"fair use," it's a case-by-case four-factor test, and what actually
protects most of those YouTube channels is platform-specific (YouTube's
Content ID lets a studio monetize instead of suing, and YouTube absorbs
the takedown process) — a standalone site has neither cushion.

So this prototype only uses films whose US copyright has **expired or
lapsed**, meaning the film itself can legally be hosted outright, no
fair-use argument required. Two ways a film ends up here:

- **Term expiration** — anything published before 1930 is now out of
  copyright in the US regardless of anything else (*Nosferatu*, *The
  Cabinet of Dr. Caligari*, *The General*).
- **Notice/renewal lapse** — some later films fell into the public
  domain because of a technicality under the copyright law in effect
  when they were made: a missing copyright notice (*Night of the Living
  Dead*) or an unrenewed registration (*His Girl Friday*).

Each film card shows a small `© Public Domain` badge; the specific
basis per film (plus a caveat where the reasoning is more
fact-dependent — renewal-lapse cases in particular are more
error-prone to verify than a straightforward "published before 1930")
lives on `about.html`, generated live from `data/films.json` so it
can't drift out of sync with the actual data. **This is not legal
advice** — verify a film's status yourself before relying on it,
especially for anything commercial.

## What's actually in this prototype

- `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js` — a static site, no build
  step at *serve* time (there is a small build step at *edit* time —
  see "Static HTML generation" below). `script.js` is pure
  progressive enhancement: it attaches hover/sound/narration behavior
  to markup that already exists, and never fetches anything or builds
  DOM from scratch.
- `about.html` — the full "why public domain" rationale plus a
  per-film basis list, statically generated from `data/films.json`.
- `data/films.json` — ten films with real metadata and hand-written
  commentary (in the target style/length for the auto-generation
  pipeline below). This is the single source of truth; both HTML
  pages are generated from it (see below), so they can't drift out of
  sync with the actual data.
- A CSS/SVG "reaction cam" in the bottom-right corner — an illustrated
  figure, not real video, so there's no likeness/rights question. Its
  expression reacts to whichever card's genre you're hovering (scared
  for horror, laughing for comedy, amazed for sci-fi) via a
  `data-mood` attribute swapped in `script.js`.

### Static HTML generation, SEO, and security

`scripts/build_static.py` reads `data/films.json` and writes the film
cards + JSON-LD structured data into `index.html`, and the per-film PD
basis list into `about.html`, replacing the content between
`<!-- SEO:...START -->` / `<!-- SEO:...END -->` marker comments in
each file. Run it after any edit to `data/films.json`:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_static.py
```

Why this exists: the film grid used to be an empty `<main id="grid">`
that `script.js` filled in at runtime via `fetch()`. That's invisible
to any crawler that doesn't execute JavaScript — most search engines
do run JS, but not reliably, and a lot of LLM/AI crawlers don't at
all. Baking the content into the actual HTML fixes that, and it's also
what let the CSP below get genuinely strict instead of needing to
leave a hole open for a live fetch.

Along with that:

- **Meta tags** — description, Open Graph, Twitter Card, and a
  canonical URL on both pages, so shared links get a real title/
  description/image instead of nothing.
- **JSON-LD** (`index.html` only) — a `WebSite` + `ItemList` of
  `Movie` entries, generated from the same film data, for search
  engines and LLM crawlers that read structured data.
- **Content-Security-Policy** — `script-src 'self' '<hash>'` (the
  hash covers only the generated JSON-LD block; everything else is
  the external `script.js`, no inline scripts anywhere), plus locked
  `style-src`/`img-src`/`media-src` to `'self'`, `connect-src 'none'`
  (nothing on either page fetches anything at runtime anymore),
  `object-src`/`base-uri`/`form-action` all disabled. Verified with a
  Playwright check that an injected inline `<script>` is actually
  refused, not just declared. GitHub Pages can't set custom HTTP
  headers, so this ships as a `<meta http-equiv>` tag instead of a
  real header — was a real limitation on GitHub Pages (no custom
  headers there, and `frame-ancestors` isn't supported via `<meta>` at
  all per spec). Now that this deploys on Vercel, `vercel.json` can
  set real HTTP headers including `frame-ancestors` / `X-Frame-Options`
  — see the Vercel section below.
- **`robots.txt`** — now genuinely effective: this repo deploys at its
  own domain's actual root, so robots.txt is honored by crawlers the
  normal way (it wasn't, at the old GitHub Pages subpath — kept
  correct-in-advance there for exactly this move).
- **`sitemap.xml`** — regenerated by `build_static.py`, lists every
  page including each film's own. Submit it in Google Search Console /
  Bing Webmaster Tools; the `Sitemap:` line in `robots.txt` also
  points crawlers at it automatically now that robots.txt itself is
  honored.
- **`llms.txt`** — a plain-language summary of the site for AI
  crawlers, following the emerging (not yet standardized) llms.txt
  convention.
- **Per-film pages** — every film also gets its own page at the site
  root (`<film-id>.html`, e.g. `nosferatu-1922.html`), generated by
  the same script (`build_film_pages()`). Each has its own title, meta
  description, canonical URL, OG/Twitter tags (using that film's own
  poster as the share image), and a single-film `Movie` JSON-LD entity
  with its own CSP hash — rather than every film sharing one URL and
  one generic `ItemList`, each now has a real, independently indexable
  and shareable page. `sitemap.xml` includes all of them. A film's
  title (on its card, and each poster-strip thumbnail) links to its
  own page; clicking anywhere else on a card's body does too (the
  controls that already do something else -- the sound toggle, the
  narrate button, the archive.org link, the PD badge -- are excluded
  from that, they keep their own behavior).
- **Cache-busting** — `styles.css`/`script.js` are referenced with a
  `?v=<hash-of-those-two-files>` query string, computed fresh on every
  build. Without this, a browser (or GitHub's CDN, briefly) can serve
  last version's CSS/JS alongside this version's HTML right after a
  deploy, which looks exactly like "the fix isn't live" when it
  actually is -- happened more than once before this was added.

### Ad slots

There are two reserved ad slots at the current catalog size — one
under the header, one in-feed after the sixth film card
(`.poster-strip`/`.poster-strip-frame` in `styles.css`, both generated
into `index.html` by `build_static.py`; named that instead of
anything containing "ad" because generic ad-blocker filter lists hide
`.ad-*`/`data-ad-*` elements outright). The in-feed placement scales
with the catalog rather than being hardcoded to "after card 6" forever
— `render_cards()`'s `IN_FEED_AD_FIRST`/`IN_FEED_AD_REPEAT` constants
insert one after the 6th card, then one every 8 cards after that (14,
22, 30, ...), so a growing catalog gets more slots without anyone
hand-placing them — three at the current 22-film size. Tighten
`IN_FEED_AD_REPEAT` later if that ever feels too sparse. Neither slot
loads a real ad yet; there's no ad network account to point them at.
Rather than sit empty, each shows a slow horizontally-scrolling
filmstrip built from the site's own footage — each film's video
poster plus three extra frames pulled from its clip by
`scripts/extract_posterstrip_frames.py` (well over 80 films' worth of stills as
of this writing, not just 10), each tile sized to the image's own
16:9 aspect ratio so the whole picture shows, not a stretched sliver
of it, dimmed slightly so it doesn't compete with the real film grid.
Each tile also links to that film's own page, so the slot doubles as
navigation, not just filler -- it's no longer `aria-hidden` for that
reason. Run `extract_posterstrip_frames.py` after fetching any new
film's clip to add its frames to the rotation. To activate a slot for
real:
sign up for a network (Google AdSense is the obvious first stop,
though very low-traffic/prototype sites are frequently rejected until
there's real traffic — worth revisiting once this has an audience),
then swap the `.ad-carousel` markup inside the corresponding
`.ad-slot` element for that network's script/tag.

### Monetization status

Ad slots and the archive.org "watch the full film" links are both
built, but two things still need a decision only you can make, since
I can't create accounts on your behalf: which ad network to sign up
for (AdSense vs. an alternative), and whether to pursue affiliate
links at all (there's no natural affiliate program for public-domain
films on archive.org — the free "watch the full film" link already
covers that — so affiliate revenue here would more likely come from
something adjacent, like Amazon links to Blu-ray reissues or
criterion-style physical media of these titles, which I haven't
built since it wasn't clear that's actually what you had in mind).

### The clips are real footage, sourced from archive.org

This prototype was originally built inside a sandboxed environment
whose network policy blocked outbound access to archive.org and every
general web host (only package registries and Anthropic's own API were
reachable). That was a deliberate policy denial, not a bug, so the
first pass didn't attempt to route around it — it shipped with
synthetic placeholder clips instead, generated locally with
`scripts/make_placeholder_clips.sh` (grain, vignette, title card,
correct length read from each film's `clip.duration_sec`, honestly
labeled as a placeholder on the frame).

The environment's network policy was then reconfigured to allow
`archive.org` and its file-serving CDN subdomains (`*.us.archive.org`
— archive.org serves actual video files from per-item hosts like
`ia601606.us.archive.org`, so the wildcard is required, not just the
apex domain). With that open, every clip in `assets/clips/` was
re-sourced for real using `scripts/fetch_clip.py`:

1. Search archive.org for a print of the film, and sanity-check it
   (not `is_dark`, plausible runtime, actually black-and-white where
   that matters — see the Metropolis note below).
2. Scout for the right moment by pulling low-res contact-sheet frames
   at coarse intervals across the likely part of the film, then
   narrowing in — all via ranged HTTP requests against the remote
   file, no full download needed.
3. Run `fetch_clip.py` with the film id, the direct file URL, and the
   in-point timestamp found by scouting. It seeks directly into the
   remote file (`-ss` before `-i`) and re-encodes just that ~10s
   segment, so it never downloads the full film (except when a
   file's moov atom forces a full download anyway -- see the
   Häxan/Reefer Madness note below).
4. Update `clip.start_timestamp`/`status`/`source_identifier`/
   `source_url` in `data/films.json` (`fetch_clip.py` prints the line
   to change), and correct `scene_label`/`scene_description`/
   `commentary` if the actual footage doesn't match what was guessed
   before sourcing — several did shift (e.g. Nosferatu's clip turned
   out to be the claw-hand silhouette at the window, not a literal
   staircase shot as first assumed; His Girl Friday's is the editor's
   office scene, not the newsroom bullpen).

**ffmpeg needs to be told about the proxy explicitly** in an
environment like this one — unlike `curl`, it doesn't read
`HTTPS_PROXY` automatically, so `fetch_clip.py` detects the env var
and passes `-http_proxy`/`-ca_file` to ffmpeg itself when set (see
`proxy_args()` in the script). On a normal machine with no such proxy
this is a no-op.

**Häxan/Reefer Madness caveat**: `fetch_clip.py`'s remote seek
(`-ss` before `-i` on the archive.org URL) hung indefinitely against
both of those files rather than erroring — their moov atom appears to
sit late enough in the file that ffmpeg couldn't cheaply locate it
through range requests over this proxy. Worked around it by
downloading the full file directly with `curl` (fast and reliable —
confirmed separately) and running the same scale/encode ffmpeg
command against that local copy instead of the remote URL; output is
byte-for-byte the same pipeline otherwise. If a new film's remote
fetch hangs rather than failing outright, this is the first thing to
suspect.

**Metropolis caveat**: the only readily-available prints on
archive.org are the 2010 "complete" restoration (~150 min), which adds
footage discovered after the film's original 1927 release. That
newly-restored material has its own preservation-era copyright
question. This clip is limited to the robot-transformation shot
specifically, which was present in every prior public-domain cut of
the film — a plain rescan of pre-existing PD frames is unlikely to
carry its own copyright, but this is a narrower claim than the other
five films' and is called out in that film's `pd_caveat`.

Re-running `make_placeholder_clips.sh` would overwrite these with
synthetic placeholders again — it's kept for adding new films quickly
before their real clip is sourced, not for the thirteen that already
have one.

### Commentary generation

`data/films.json`'s commentary was hand-written in the style/length
target (45-65 words, ~20 second read) that the real pipeline should
produce. `scripts/generate_commentary.py` is that real pipeline: given
a film's metadata and scene description, it calls the Claude API for a
commentary paragraph, and can write results back into `films.json`
with `--write`. It needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set — get one at
[console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/).

### Narration

Each "Listen" button plays a pre-generated voice clip rather than
calling any API live from the browser — a static site can't hide an
API key from visitors, so narration has to be baked into a static
asset the same way the film clips are. `scripts/generate_narration.py`
calls ElevenLabs' TTS API once per film and writes
`assets/narration/<film-id>.mp3`. It needs `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` set
and a `--voice-id`:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_narration.py --voice-id <voice_id>
```

If a film's MP3 is missing (e.g. a new film added before running this
script) or fails to load, `script.js` falls back to the browser's
built-in speech synthesis automatically — same as before narration
audio existed at all. Both paths are deliberately paced a little
slower than each API's default (ElevenLabs' `voice_settings.speed:
0.85`; the browser fallback's `utterance.rate = 0.85`) after early
feedback that the default pace read too fast.

## Running it locally

No build step needed:

```bash
cd retroclips
python3 -m http.server 8000
# open http://localhost:8000/
```

## Adding a new film

1. Confirm its US copyright status is actually expired or lapsed —
   don't take a random site's word for it.
2. Add an entry to `data/films.json` (copy an existing one as a
   template) with `clip.status: "placeholder"`.
3. Run `scripts/make_placeholder_clips.sh` to get a placeholder clip
   for it immediately, or `scripts/fetch_clip.py` if you already have
   a real source URL and timestamp.
4. Optionally run `scripts/generate_commentary.py --film-id <id>
   --write` instead of writing the commentary by hand.
5. Run `scripts/generate_narration.py --film-id <id>` to generate its
   narration audio.
6. Run `scripts/extract_posterstrip_frames.py` to pull its frames
   into the ad-slot poster-strip rotation (optional but cheap — local
   only, no network).
7. Run `scripts/build_static.py` to regenerate the static HTML card
   in `index.html`, its entry in `about.html`, and `sitemap.xml` —
   without this step the new film won't actually appear on the site.

## Not done yet / open questions

- **Domain** — RetroClips now lives in its own repo
  (`github.com/dietersilva/retroclips`) deploying via Vercel, rather
  than as a subpath of the original monorepo's GitHub Pages site.
  `retroclips.com` and `.co` are already taken; a shortlist of
  available alternatives has been priced and presented
  (`theretroclips.com` is the recommendation), but nothing has been
  purchased yet — that's a real-money step waiting on an explicit
  pick. Until a custom domain is bought and attached, the site runs on
  its Vercel-assigned `*.vercel.app` URL.
- **Reaction cam** — still an illustrated SVG, not real video, so
  there's no likeness/rights question, but its four expressions
  (neutral/scared/laughing/amazed) are simple shape swaps. A real
  video version would need either licensed stock reaction footage or
  an AI-generated avatar — not attempted here.
- **Scale** — ten films is still a proof of concept, not a catalog.
  The public-domain feature-film pool is large (archive.org alone
  lists hundreds), but each one still needs its PD status individually
  confirmed and a real in-point timestamped by hand — there's no
  shortcut for either step.
